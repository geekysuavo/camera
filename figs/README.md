# camera/figs

This directory contains all scripts used to generate figures for the
**camera** publication in the _Journal of Magnetic Resonance_.

## Running the scripts

You can build all figures (provided their datasets in [../tests](../tests/)
have been built first) by running **make** from here, or selectively build
any single figure by changing into its directory and running **make** there.
